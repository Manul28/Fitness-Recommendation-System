# Predictive Analytics for Personalized Fitness Recommendations

## Overview

This project aims to develop a personalized fitness recommendation system that caters to the specific needs and preferences of Indian students. The system will leverage machine learning techniques to analyze user data and generate tailored workout plans and dietary advice.

## Key Features

-> Data Collection: Collects user data including demographics, health metrics, fitness goals, and lifestyle preferences.

-> Recommendation Engine: Utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms to generate personalized recommendations.

-> Privacy and Security: Employs federated learning, differential privacy, and encryption to protect sensitive user data.

-> Cultural Adaptation: Incorporates popular Indian fitness activities and dietary options, and supports multiple Indian languages.

-> User Engagement: Features gamification, challenges, and social support to motivate users to stick to their fitness plans.

-> Technical Implementation: Leverages Python, Streamlit, and machine learning libraries for development and deployment.
